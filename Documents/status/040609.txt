Here are a few things that I would like to talk about on our wednesday
call:

    1.  Mock-ups

    2.  Help

    3.  Testbank  (follow-up to Jim's email)

    4.  All features are complete (or will be by Wednesday).  How do they
        look? What is missing?

            - import export
            - search
            - change category name

    5.  Layout ok?

    6.  Project Name? (SchoolManager is taken on sourceforge.net)

    7.  sourceforge.net project submission?

    8.  bug fix mode



Greg
